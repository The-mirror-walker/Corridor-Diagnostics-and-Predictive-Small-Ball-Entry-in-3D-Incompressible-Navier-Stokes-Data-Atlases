This repository accompanies the paper:

**Corridor Diagnostics and Predictive Small-Ball Entry in 3D Incompressible Navier–Stokes: An Empirical Atlas Study**

[arXiv link]

It provides the diagnostic atlas bundles, solver outputs, and supporting data
used in the analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `DYADIC_TOWER_complete_N128/` — Full diagnostic atlas for the dyadic tower
  initial condition at resolution N=128.
- `DYADIC_TOWER_WF_spread_N128/` — Window length and fractional threshold
  sweep demonstrating detector robustness for the same trajectory.
